# Development Tasks

1. STARTED: Log when no usernames are available for brute force
    - Currently in progress
2. NOT STARTED: Refactor callback structure to accept `*args, **kwargs`
    - in theory, this'll prevent forcing developers to hardcode values in a given script -- such as when multiple hosts might be targeted for attack
